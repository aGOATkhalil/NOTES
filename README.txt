The purpose of this repo is to compile all notes from my college courses that I believe are worth keeping as a reference for the future.
The notes will be summarized and put into seperate files written in LaTeX. 

This file will, or does include, the following topics:

PHYSICS - Intro to Electricity and Magnetism
PHYSICS - Introductory Mechanics
PHYSICS - Intro to Thermodynamics and Optics
MATH - Calculus II
MATH - Caluclus III
MATH - Ordinary Differential Equations
MATH - Math Analysis for Engineers
MATERIALS SCIENCE - Intro to Materials Science
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING - Elements of Electrical Engineering
CHEMISTRY - General Chemistry I and II (maybe)
